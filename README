the sentiment of tweets..
• Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, to clean and
prepare the Twitter data for sentiment analysis..
• Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification by training the Naive Bayes classifier on a large labeled dataset and
optimizing feature selection and model parameters.
